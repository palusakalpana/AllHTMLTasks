    <h1>My First Code</h1>
    <p>In my first class, I have learnt about Java Full Stack.</p>
    <p>Java Full Stack development involves working with both front-end and back-end technologies. It includes learning Java for server-side development, frameworks like Spring and Hibernate, and front-end tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, it covers database management systems like MySQL or MongoDB and version control systems like Git.</p>
    <p>This skill set enables developers to build complete web applications from start to finish, ensuring they understand all parts of the development process.</p>
